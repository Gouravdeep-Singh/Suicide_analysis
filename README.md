# Suicide_analysis
In this project, I aim to analyze a dataset containing suicide rates from various countries over the years. The dataset encompasses vital information about suicide cases and demographic variables. By exploring this dataset, I hope to shed light on the critical issue of mental health and understand the factors influencing suicide rates. To achieve this, I will use MySQL for data preprocessing, cleansing, and transformation, and then present findings through a compelling story using Tableau visualizations.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing with MySQL: We will use MySQL to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and standardizing the data format for analysis. This step ensures that our data is accurate and ready for exploration.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using MySQL, we will perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset. This step involves summarizing statistics, visualizing trends, and identifying any outliers or anomalies that may require further investigation.

Identifying Correlations: By utilizing MySQL, we will conduct a correlation analysis between suicide rates and socio-economic factors. This will help us understand the potential drivers behind suicide rates and their association with various demographic variables.

Creating the Tableau Story: Once we have extracted valuable insights from the dataset, we will build an engaging and informative Tableau story. The story will be designed to present the data in a visually compelling way, using interactive dashboards, charts, and maps.

Through this project, I hope to draw attention to the critical issue of mental health and its connection to suicide rates. By analyzing the dataset and building a compelling Tableau story, I aim to inspire meaningful conversations, advocate for increased mental health resources, and foster a collective effort to prevent suicide and support those struggling with mental health challenges.
